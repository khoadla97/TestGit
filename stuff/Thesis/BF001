3 methods for reducing dynamic power consumption of cmos inverter
 - reduce operating frequency
 - reduce load capac
 - reduce power supply voltage

2 regions 

- linear re
- sat region
- vds = vgs - vth 

what are 2 regions in ids-vgs curve
- sub threshold region
- power region

List 4 methods to reduce delay time of an inverteer
 - to reduce load capac
 - increase power supply vol
 - reduce vth
 - increase beta

Which transistor nmos or pmos faster? reason?
 - nmos faster than pmos
 - mobility of nmos almost 3 times larger than pmos
 - current flow in a transitor is proportional to the mobility of carrier.

3 goals in lsi design:
 - functional in compliance with the spec
 - performance 
 - time to market and profitable.

3 ways to increase te source-drain current of MOS transistor:
 - wident the channel width, W
 - decrease Vth,
 - reduce the gate oxide thickness, tox

How to reduce the sub-threshold leakage current after a MOS transistor is fabricated.
- apply the bias voltage to the subtrate node: negative for nMOs and positive for pMOS
The maxaimum value of source-drain current is reduced and therefore, the transistor becomes slower.

2 major timing parameters in synchronous design and describe the reason
- input setup time of a ff
- input hold time of a ff
- the input stable during the setup and hold time can prevent metastable behavior 

select appropriate items for current scaling
- power supply voltage (1/k)
- delay time (1/k)
- electric field (1)
- power consumption (1/k^2)
